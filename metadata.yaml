description: "Divorce, also known as dissolution of marriage, is the termination of\
  \ a marriage or marital union, the canceling or reorganizing of the legal duties\
  \ and responsibilities of marriage, thus dissolving the bonds of matrimony between\
  \ a married couple under the rule of law of the particular country or state. Divorce\
  \ laws vary considerably around the world, but in most countries divorce requires\
  \ the sanction of a court or other authority in a legal process, which may involve\
  \ issues of alimony (spousal support), child custody, child visitation / access,\
  \ parenting time, child support, distribution of property, and division of debt.\
  \ In most countries, monogamy is required by law, so divorce allows each former\
  \ partner to marry another person; where polygyny is legal but polyandry is not,\
  \ divorce allows the woman to marry another person.\nDivorce should not be confused\
  \ with annulment, which declares the marriage null and void, with legal separation\
  \ or de jure separation (a legal process by which a married couple may formalize\
  \ a de facto separation while remaining legally married) or with de facto separation\
  \ (a process where the spouses informally stop cohabiting). Reasons for divorce\
  \ vary, from sexual incompatibility or lack of independence for one or both spouses\
  \ to a personality clash.\nThe only countries that do not allow divorce are the\
  \ Philippines, the Vatican City and the British Crown Dependency of Sark. In the\
  \ Philippines, divorce for non-Muslim Filipinos is not legal unless the husband\
  \ or wife is an alien and satisfies certain conditions. The Vatican City is an ecclesiastical\
  \ state, which has no procedure for divorce. Countries that have relatively recently\
  \ legalized divorce are Italy (1970), Portugal (1975), Brazil (1977), Spain (1981),\
  \ Argentina (1987), Paraguay (1991), Colombia (1991*), Andorra (1995), Ireland (1996),\
  \ Chile (2004) and Malta (2011).\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
